    <h1>Which photos should I delete?</h1>
      <p>June 2025‚Äî How to mentally get over deleting old photos that take up your phone space. Make space for new beauty to be captured. :)  </p> 

    <br>
    <p> (This article isn't written that seriously, by the way.)</p>

    <br><br>

    <p>
      ‚ÄúYou do not have enough storage to take more photos. Free up space by deleting‚Ä¶‚Äù That little popup haunted me. I only had around 2,900 photos on my iPhone camera roll, but apparently, that was enough to clog up everything. When I finally opened my gallery to delete things, I realized it wasn‚Äôt just a storage problem, but an emotional one. Which photos do I delete? Which pieces of my past am I really ready to let go of? :(
    </p>

    <h2>üåÄ Failed Photography Attempts</h2>
    <p>The first category I tackled were failed photography attempts... you know, when you try so hard to get a photo of a leaf, a sunset, a perfect cup of noodles... and you take like 15 shots trying to frame it just right, only for it to never really become anything ‚Äúphotography-worthy.‚Äù I realized I didn‚Äôt need to keep all those efforts. I can let them go, knowing I tried. Not every photo has to become art. Some were just part of the learning curve.</p>

    <p>I tried my best editing these below but they just looked off. It's been 8 months... So I decided to just delete them now üòÄ </p>
    <div class="page_row">
      <div class="double_column">
        <img  src="/blog_images/which_to_delete/build_which_to_delete.jpg" alt="before" style="width:100%">
      </div>
      <div class="double_column">

      </div>
    </div> 

    <p>These roses look great, but I don't really like the petal distribution on either. I like saying "try to make everything art", but these just don't sit right. üòÄ </p>
    <div class="page_row">
      <div class="double_column">
        <img  src="/blog_images/which_to_delete/rose_which_to_delete.jpg" alt="before" style="width:100%">

    </div> 

    <p>These too... the reflection (left) looks off, and the soup (right) looks too dark. On the left image, I was trying to add a "retro" effect; it has potential to become "photography worthy", but I just can't seem to position it right. On the right image, the soup one, I kind of lacked a main subject to focus on. Is it the soy bottle (slightly blurred) or the noodle bowl, which isn't even really positioned straight? A potential fix is to zoom the photo, so that the soy bottle is at the 1/3rd division line to the right. But still ...</p>

    <h2>üõçÔ∏è Your "Slice of Life" Photos Can Go, Too</h2>
    <p>Don't attack me on this: I'm sure you can relate. So then, we have our "slice of life" photos. These were trickier, because they once felt meaningful: for example, a photo of a beef Cup-o-Noodle flavor in Flushing, a cute Hello Kitty Milkis flavor (I never seen in real life before), or a cool display of instant rice noodles. I remember taking those pictures because I was genuinely amazed. But now, almost a year later, I look at them and just feel‚Ä¶ "eh." They aren‚Äôt super unique anymore, and I could technically see or eat them again next time I go. So I let those go too. </p>
    <p>The only reason I took the beef ramen photo (left) is because I never seen a Cup-O-Noodle Beef flavor in real life before. And I thought the food (right) was really good, like the baozi looked very juicy. But I feel like I didn't really need to keep these photos, since when I think back, I think "oh yea they had baozi, and it was good", not "ahh, so nostalgic~ brings me back to childhood ü•∫ ". So these ... can go to the trash.</p>

    <p>The milkis photo‚Äî I took it because I never saw the Hello Kitty collab flavor before. The instant noodles photo‚Äî I took it because I thought the colors and variety was cool. I deleted these though, because ... I just don't really need these in my storage. It's not like I don't know these amazing food flavors exist. I can always search it up online...</p>

    <p>Same with these. I thought the shark plush (left) was cute and the many traintracks (right) was interesting. </p>
